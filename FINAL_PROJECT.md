# MUSA 5090 Spring 2024 Final Project

I've included some details about the final project below. If there are any updates to this information, I will make an announcement about it in class and on Canvas.

## What's the project?

At a high level, I want to see you incorporate some of the cloud-based components we've been talking about in class into an existing or new project. For example, this could be:
- a web application that uses data in a database to respond to live requests from the browser
- a data pipeline that ingests some data and does some analysis on it in BigQuery and visualizes the results in Carto
- a machine learning model that runs on data processed in BigQuery and visualizes the results in Carto
- a containerized process (or set of processes) that is run in a cloud workflow
- ...or something else! The key is that you're using cloud-based components to do it.

If you are already doing data-focussed projects for another class, talk to me about how you might be able to augment that project to fit this class.

## When is it due?

**Proposal:** You _must_ give me a proposal of what you're doing for the project by **April 10th**. The proposal does not have to be complicated. Just let me know:
1.  A high-level description of what you're doing
2.  Who is on your team
3.  What data you're going to use, and
4.  What cloud-based components you think you're going to use

As you develop the idea for your project, please add it to the spreadsheet I shared in the Canvas anouncement.

**Presentation:** You should prepare, record, and upload a presentation by **May 8th** (I'll provide a form to upload your video). The presentation should be 5-10 minutes, and should include:
1.  A high-level description of what you did
2.  A discussion of the cloud-based components you used, and how data flows between them
3.  A demo of your project

Take a look at the video from last year for an examples.

**Code:** You should also upload your code to a GitHub repository by **May 8th**.

## Can we work in a team?

Yes, I'll allow teams of up to 3 people. I'm not going to _assign_ any teams though. If you're open to working with team members on your project, check the box in the last column of the projects spread sheet.

## Do you have examples?

Check out the video from last year's projects on YouTube at the link I shared on Canvas (unfortunately some of the teams forgot to share the screen when they came up, but hopefully you'll get the idea).
